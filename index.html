                        <p>I would not challenge a giant. You're such a wonderful person â€” but you got problems. Don't tell your papa or he'll get us locked up in fright! Sometimes I feel the need to move on; so I pack a bag and move on. Don't pick fights with the bullies or the cads. </p>

                        <p>It's War-hol, actually. I'm floating in a most peculiar way. The far side of town, where the thin men stalk the streets while the sane stay underground. Dignity is valuable, but our lives are valuable too. He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon. Last night they loved you, opening doors and pulling some strings. </p>
